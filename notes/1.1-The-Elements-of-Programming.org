A programming language is more than just a means for instructing a
computer to perform tasks. It serves as a framework within which we
organize our ideas about processes.

Every language has three mechanisms that combine simple idea into more
complex ones:
1. Primitive Expressions: Simplest entities in the language
2. Means of Combination: Compound elements are build from simpler ones
3. Means of Abstraction: Compound elements can be named and
   manipulated as units.
   
* 1.1.1 Expressions
  
  (+ 137 349)
  Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of expressions
  within parantheses in order to denote procedure application, are
  called combinations. Leftmost element is the operator and the other
  elements are called operands.
  
  Lisp follows prefix notation.
  
  The interpreter always operates in the same basic cycle known as
  read-eval-print loop.

  nothing." - Alan Perlis
  
* 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment
  
  A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides
  for using names to refer to computational objects. We say that the
  name identifies a variable whose value is the object.
  
  define is our language's simplest means of abstraction, for it allows
  us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations.
  
  It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with
  symbols and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must
  maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object
  pairs. This memory is called the environment or more precisely the
  global environment.
  
* 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations
  
  Let's assume the interpreter follows a procedure in order to
  evaluate combinations:
1. Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
   This step indicates that the evaluation is recursive in nature,
   since we have to 'evaluate' the subexpressions using this very same rules.
2. Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression
   (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other
   subexpressions (the operands).
   
   The equation:
   (* (+ 2 (* 4 6))
   (+ 3 5 7)) 
   can be represented in the form of a tree: [[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/ch1-Z-G-1.gif][Figure 1.1 Equation Tree]]
   Terminal nodes represent either operators or numbers.
   
Viewing evaluation in terms of the tree, we can imagine the values of
the operands percolate upward, starting from the terminal nodes and
then combining at higher and higher levels.

We shall see that recursion is a very powerful technique for dealing
with hierarchical, treelike objects. In fact, the "percolate values
upward" form of the evaluation rule is an example of a general kind of
process known as tree accumulation.

The environment plays a key role in determining the meaning of the symbols.

(define x 3) is not a combination but rather it associates x with 3.

These are known as special forms. Each special form has it's own
evaluation rule.
