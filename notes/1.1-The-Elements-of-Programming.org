A programming language is more than just a means for instructing a
computer to perform tasks. It serves as a framework within which we
organize our ideas about processes.

Every language has three mechanisms that combine simple idea into more
complex ones:
1. Primitive Expressions: Simplest entities in the language
2. Means of Combination: Compound elements are build from simpler ones
3. Means of Abstraction: Compound elements can be named and
   manipulated as units.
   
* 1.1.1 Expressions

Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of expressions
within parantheses in order to denote procedure application, are
called combinations. Leftmost element is the operator and the other
elements are called operands.

Lisp follows prefix notation.
